# simple-calculator
a simple calculator written in Lua, up to 4 numbers sum, up to 4 numbers difference, up to 4 numbers multiplication, 2 numbers division

you can add up to 4 numbers

(after the first 2 numbers it will ask you if you want to add a third number to the sum;
after the third number it will ask you if you want to add a fourth number to the sum)

Example:

10 + 20 

or 

10 + 20 + 30 

or 

10 + 20 + 30 + 40

you can subtract up to 4 numbers

(after the first 2 numbers it will ask you if you want to add a third number to the difference;
after the third number it will ask you if you want to add a fourth number to the difference)

Example: 

100 - 40 

or 

100 - 40 - 30 

or 

100 - 40 - 30 - 20

you can multiply up to 4 numbers 

(after the first 2 numbers it will ask you if you want to add a third number to the multiplication;
after the third number it will ask you if you want to add a fourth number to the multiplication)

Example: 

10 * 20 

or 

10 * 20 * 30 

or 

10 * 20 * 30 * 40

you can divide 2 numbers 

Example: 

100 / 20

the printed result for the sum will be:

|first number| + |second number| = |Result|

or

|first number| + |second number| + |third number| = |Result|

or

|first number| + |second number| + |third number| + |fourth number| = |Result|

the printed result for the difference will be:

|first number| - |second number| = |Result|

or

|first number| - |second number| - |third number| = |Result|

or

|first number| - |second number| - |third number| - |fourth number| = |Result|

the printed result for the multiplication will be:

|first number| * |second number| = |Result|

or

|first number| * |second number| * |third number| = |Result|

or

|first number| * |second number| * |third number| * |fourth number| = |Result|

the printed result for the division will be:

|first number| / |second number| = |Result|
